        <p id="displayText" class="hidden">In 2020, I found myself uprooting from the familiar landscapes of Kuwait, my second home for which I lived for the past 15 years, to returning to the hectic cityscape of Korea, my motherland. This unexpected shift was driven by the profound disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The prospect of continuing my high school education in Korea unfolded as a narrative of self-discovery, marked by the nuances of adapting to a new culture, relearning my native language, and navigating the uncharted territories of a different educational system. In the midst of uncertainty, I found solace in the shared struggles and triumphs of my peers, all of us grappling with the unforeseen consequences of the global pandemic. As I stepped into the vibrant rhythm of high school life in Korea, every encounter became a brushstroke in the canvas of my unique story. It was a journey that demanded resilience, fostered adaptability, and unveiled the strength inherent in embracing change.
