            <p id="displayText" class="hidden">During my trip to Los Angeles when I was 15, I couldn't help but feel overwhelmed by the sheer vastness of the city. The sprawling landscape and endless highways left me feeling somewhat lost in the urban expanse. The city, while undoubtedly possessing a unique charm, seemed to lack the vibrant energy and density that I appreciate in places like New York or Seoul. The seemingly endless urban sprawl and the noticeable urban decay in certain areas made me yearn for the lively streets and compact neighborhoods that I find comfort in. It became clear that my preference lies in more densely populated cities, where the hustle and hecticness are concentrated in defined spaces, creating a sense of community and vitality that Los Angeles, with its expansive nature, didn't quite capture for me.
