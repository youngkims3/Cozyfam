        <p id="displayText" class="hidden">In 2016, I bid farewell to the sun-soaked landscapes of Kuwait that had been my home for many cherished years. The decision to uproot from the familiar rhythms of life in Kuwait and venture towards the distant shores of Vancouver, Canada, was not without its complexities. The call for change resonated deeply, spurred by a myriad of reasons, but chiefly influenced by the pursuit of new opportunities and experiences. As I navigated the corridors of uncertainty, leaving behind friends, routines, and the desert's warm embrace, I took the challenge with determination. Vancouver's crisp air and the promise of a Canadian education unfolded before me, beckoning me to carve out my place in this vibrant multicultural tapestry. The prospect of a new middle school, diverse cultural encounters, and the beauty of the Pacific Northwest became the canvas upon which my evolving identity would paint its narrative strokes. This transition, though daunting, carried the promise of growth, learning, and the forging of a unique story in the breathtaking landscapes of my newfound home. Sadly, after two unforgettable years, I had to abruptly leave Canada to Korea, for the betterment of my health.
